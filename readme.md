# Basic SpeechRecorder clone

`rec.py` contains a basic [SpeechRecorder](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/research/projects/speechrecorder/) clone written
in Python which should be system-agnostic. Tested using Python 3.7, but 3.6+ should work well.

This code is set up to record Arctic A, but it is easy to adopt it for other texts.

Current version only saves one take. If you redo a part, it will overwrite the previous take.

This code is not the prettiest, I just wanted a quick tool that works. I do think all the bits around it
(like saving multiple takes or loading different utterances) should be very easy to add if you know some python.

## Prerequisites
Python packages:

* [PySoundFile](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [python-sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.15/installation.html)
    * I recommend using [this](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#sounddevice) version (e.g. `pip install sounddevice‑0.3.15‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl`) as it includes a working version of PyAudio

You need to configure the correct Input and Output devices by hand for this tool to work:

Run the following commands to list available audio devices in a Python interpreter:

```python
import sounddevice as sd
print(sd.query_devices())
``` 

From the list, note the indices of the devices you want to use for playback/recording and fill their numbers into the following lines of code in `rec.py`:
```python
in_device = 10
out_device = 3
CHANNEL = 1
``` 
If you're using an audio interface with many input channels, and your microphone is plugged into input 8, put `CHANNEL=8`.

## How to use
Run `rec.py` with `python rec.py`.

* Press `up` and `down` to navigate sentences
* Press `space` to record
* Press `down` while recording to immediately record the next utterance (without stopping in between)
* When not recording, press `p` to listen to the recorded audio
* Press `q` to quit.

To use a text other than Arctic A, change `labels` and `utts` to be (same-length) python lists containing the identifier 
(used for saved file names) and utterances.
